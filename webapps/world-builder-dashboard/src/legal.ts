                content: 
`
<h4>a.	Digital Wallet</h4>
To access and participate in the Services, you will need to connect a supported third-party digital asset wallet, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet (a “<strong>Digital Wallet</strong>”), to the Services. All Digital Wallet services are Third-Party Services (as defined below) within the meaning of these Terms. By using a Digital Wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable third-party provider of the wallet. Digital Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Game7, and Game7 does not have custody or control over the contents and assets of any Digital Wallet, and does not have the ability to retrieve or transfer the contents or assets of any Digital Wallet. Game7 accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of any Digital Wallet, and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific Digital Wallet. 
If you elect to purchase any digital asset, or make a payment for Services using any digital asset, through the Digital Wallet that you have connected to the Services (collectively, “<strong>Payments</strong>”), you acknowledge and agree that any such transactions will be conducted solely through the blockchain network governing the digital asset and that Game7 has no control over such Payments, nor does Game7 have the ability to reverse any such Payments. You acknowledge and agree that certain Payments transactions may be carried out by Third-Party Services (as defined below), such as those offered and provided at <a href="https://getsome.game7.io/" target="_blank">https://getsome.game7.io/</a>, and that Game7 has no control over such Payments, nor does Game7 have the ability to reverse any such Payments. Accordingly, Game7 will have no liability to you or to any third-party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any Payments or other transactions that you make through the Services. In certain cases, your transactions through the Services may not be successful due to an error with the Digital Wallet. Game7 accepts no responsibility or liability to you for any such failed transactions, or any transaction or gas fees that may be incurred by you in connection with such failed transactions. You are solely responsible for keeping your Digital Wallet secure, and you should never share your Digital Wallet credentials, private key or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your Digital Wallet, please contact the third-party Digital Wallet provider.
<h4>b.	Quests and Lootdrops</h4>
The Services may enable you to access certain interactive tasks, events, and/or contests made available by Game7 (each, a “<strong>Quest</strong>”). Quests may be offered as a collection or grouping of related actions or prompts called a lootdrop (“<strong>Lootdrop</strong>”). By participating in and/or completing Quests or Lootdrops, you may be offered rewards or other benefits, as communicated to you through the Services in connection with each such Quest or Lootdrop. You agree and acknowledge that Quests or Lootdrops may be offered by third-parties, including associated rewards or other benefits related to such third-party Quests or Lootdrops. You agree and acknowledge that your participation in any Quest or Lootdrop, and eligibility for any related rewards or other benefits, may be subject to additional terms, including third-party terms, and you agree to comply with all such terms. For Quests or Lootdrops that are offered by third-parties and/or rely upon third-party technology, Game7 may not be held responsible for any disruptions, malfunctions, or errors that may prevent you from completing a Quest or Lootdrop, or earning or receiving any associated rewards or other benefits. If a Quest or Lootdrop is offered by a third-party, such third-party is solely responsible for the distribution of any related rewards or other benefits to you, and Game7 does not guarantee the availability, delivery, or legitimacy of such third-party rewards or other benefits. YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE LEGITIMACY AND AUTHENTICITY OF QUEST AND LOOTDROP REWARDS, INCLUDING DIGITAL ASSETS, YOU RECEIVE THROUGH THE SERVICES.
<h4>c.	Diamonds and G7 Boxes</h4>
In connection with your access to or use of the Services you may be offered the opportunity to receive Game7 Diamonds (“<strong>Diamonds</strong>”). Diamonds are non-transferable, revocable incentives issued by Game7 through participation in Quests, Lootdrops, Staking (as defined below), and other third party events, actions, and promotions. Diamonds cannot be transferred, cannot be exchanged for cash, and have no cash value. The number of Diamonds earned or received may vary depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services, including the Site and the Protocol. Game7 reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, the number of Diamonds awarded for any given interaction. In connection with your access to or use of the Services, you may also be offered the opportunity to earn Diamonds by Staking (as defined below) G7 Tokens. Diamonds may be used to acquire rewards and gaming assets in the Game7 Diamond Store (“<strong>Diamond Store</strong>”), including Game7 Boxes (“<strong>G7 Boxes</strong>”). G7 Boxes may contain items such as digital assets or tokens, including non-fungible tokens (“<strong>NFTs</strong>”), in-game assets, and/or access to exclusive Game7 and partner rewards, gear, events, and other special offers (collectively, “<strong>G7 Box Rewards</strong>”). Each G7 Box contains pre-determined G7 Box Rewards. When you redeem Diamonds for a G7 Box, you will be randomly assigned a specific G7 Box that contains pre-determined G7 Box Rewards. All rewards and benefits offered through G7 Boxes are distributed randomly. No actions taken or consideration provided will alter the rewards or benefits received from a G7 Box or the likelihood of receiving a reward or benefit. Participation in G7 Boxes is only available through the use of Diamonds, and not through any fiat currency or other item of monetary value. G7 Boxes may contain virtual items provided for use exclusively within the Service or within a Third-Party Service (as defined below). All such exclusive items have no monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash or equivalent, and you are granted a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the items as permitted under these Terms or those terms of the Third-Party Service (as defined below), as applicable. Once Diamonds are redeemed for a G7 Box the action is irreversible. Once a G7 Box is opened the action is irreversible. The Diamond Store may impose a time delay between the time Diamonds are redeemed for a G7 Box, and the time that the acquired G7 Box may be opened.
<h4>d.	Staking and Governance</h4>
In connection with your access to or use of the Services, you may be offered the opportunity to lock up (“<strong>Stake</strong>” or “<strong>Staking</strong>”) certain digital assets or tokens, including G7 Tokens, for a set period (“<strong>Lockup Period</strong>”), which prevents the transfer of the digital assets or tokens for that set period of time. You acknowledge and agree that any digital assets or tokens which you have Staked may not be available for you to transfer or withdraw to your Digital Wallet (“<strong>Withdrawal</strong>”) during the applicable Lockup Period, including any applicable cool-down period (“<strong>Cool-Down Period</strong>”) in which the digital assets or tokens remain temporarily subject to a Lockup Period following the submission of a Withdrawal transaction. Further, the Services may allow you to vote on certain community actions, submit proposals for community actions or otherwise participate in other collective decisions (such process, “<strong>Community Governance</strong>”). Staking and Community Governance may only be offered in accordance with the rules of the Game7 Protocol.
<h4>e.	The Protocol and Fees</h4>
The Game7 Protocol enables users to do various things such as processing Ethereum and Arbitrum transactions more efficiently, passing information between or amongst the Ethereum, Arbitrum and the Game7 Mainnet blockchains (i.e. bridging), Staking certain digital assets or tokens, participating in Community Governance, and interacting with third-party smart contract-based applications that are built on the Game7 Mainnet. By accessing or using the Protocol, you may be charged applicable fees, including any fees required to execute any Protocol transaction, such as transaction, processing, or hosting fees, blockchain gas, or similar network fees (collectively, “<strong>Transaction Fees</strong>”). We will disclose an estimate of the amount of Transaction Fees we will charge or pass through to you for the applicable Service at the time you access, use, or otherwise transact with the Services, however, the final amount of such Transaction Fees will only be known and determined after a transaction is processed. Although we will attempt to provide accurate Transaction Fee information, any such information reflects our estimate of such fees, which may vary from the fees actually paid to use the Services and interact with the applicable blockchain with which the Services are compatible. In addition, your Digital Wallet provider may impose a fee to transact on the Services. Game7 is not responsible for any fees charged by a third party (“<strong>Third-Party Fees</strong>”). You agree to pay any applicable fees, including Transaction Fees, Third-Party Fees, and hosting fees, in connection with your use of and transactions using the Services. All transactions processed through the Services are non-refundable.

                content: 
`
You accept, acknowledge and assume the following risks:
<ul>
<li>a.	By accessing and using the Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of digital assets. Such systems may have vulnerabilities or other failures, or other abnormal behavior. Game7 is not responsible for any issues with the blockchain, including forks, technical node issues or any other issues that may result in the loss of funds. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum and Arbitrum are variable and may increase at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to or from the Services. You further acknowledge that Game7 is not responsible for any of these variables or risks and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing, using, or interacting with the Services. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing, using and interacting with the Services.</li>
<li>b.	There are risks associated with using digital assets and tokens, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information or assets stored within your Digital Wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Game7 will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.</li>
<li>c.	Game7 and its affiliates cannot control how third-party Digital Wallets and exchange platforms quote or value cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, and so Game7 expressly denies and disclaims any liability to you, and denies any obligations to indemnify or hold you harmless for any losses you may incur as a result of fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.</li>
<li>d.	You represent that you understand that smart contracts execute automatically when certain conditions are met, and as such, typically cannot be stopped or reversed, and that vulnerabilities in smart contract programming and design, including vulnerabilities that may arise due to hacking or other security incidents, can have adverse effects to your digital assets, including but not limited to significant volatility and risk of loss.</li>
<li>e.	Certain protocols and networks require that a certain amount of Staked assets be locked for a certain Lockup Period while Staking, and Withdrawal of Staked assets may be delayed. Game7 does not guarantee the security or functionality of any Third-Party Service, including any third-party protocol, software or technology, intended to be compatible with Game7 assets.</li>
<li>f.	Game7 may rely on third-party platforms to provide the Services. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Services may suffer.</li>
<li>g.	You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions. Game7 and its affiliates are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to any such transactions. You are solely responsible for maintaining all relevant tax records and complying with any reporting requirements you may have as related to Game7 Services or Third-Party Services. You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the Services or Third-Party Services.</li>
<li>h.	The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services.</li>

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
<h3>a.	Informal Resolution of Disputes</h3>
In the event of any dispute between you and Game7 arising out of or relating to the use of the Services, these Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”), either party must first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy informally. Accordingly, neither you nor Game7 may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing. As part of this informal resolution process, you must deliver your written notices via hand or first-class mail to us at Game7 DAO, Floor 4, Banco Popular Building, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.
<h3>b.	Mandatory Binding Arbitration of Disputes</h3>
After the informal dispute resolution process has been exhausted, any remaining Disputes will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration (and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding), including threshold questions of arbitrability of any Disputes. You hereby waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms and the Services, including claims related to privacy and data security resolved in court. Further, you hereby waive all rights to participate in any class action lawsuit or class wide arbitration against Game7. Instead, any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, as well as any issue on its validity and existence, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the BVI International Arbitration Centre (“<strong>BVI IAC</strong>”) in accordance with the BVI IAC Rules for the time being in force. The seat of the arbitration shall be the British Virgin Islands. The Tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, appointed by Game7. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
<h3>c.	Exceptions</h3>
As limited exceptions to Section 16(b) above: (i) both parties may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court in the British Virgin Islands if it qualifies; and (ii) each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of its intellectual property rights. Any dispute about whether a Dispute qualifies for small claims court will be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator, in which case the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until the small claims court issues a decision that the Dispute should proceed in arbitration.
<h3>d.	Class Action Waiver</h3>
All Disputes must be submitted on an individual basis. No Disputes may be arbitrated on a class or collective basis. You and Game7 expressly waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class action, collective action or other representative or joint action, regardless of whether the action is filed in arbitration or in court. This provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

<h3>a.	Reservation of Rights</h3>
Game7 and its licensors exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.
<h3>b.	Entire Agreement</h3>
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Game7 and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Game7 and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Game7’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, without such consent, will be null and void in its entirety. Game7 may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
<h3>c.	Notices</h3>
Any notices or other communications provided by Game7 under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
<h3>d.	Waiver of Rights</h3>
Game7’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Game7. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
        
<ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Consent.</strong><br/><br/>

        <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong><br/><br/>
        We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:<br/><br/>
    </li>
      <li>
       Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities<br/><br/>

    </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vital Interests.</strong><br/><br/>
       We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.
<br/><br/>
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
<ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>

    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>

    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>

    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>

    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>

    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>

    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

<br/><br/>
You may contact us by email at contact@game7.io, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
<br/><br/>
If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt out we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.
<br/><br/>
Will your information be shared with anyone else?
<br/><br/>
We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.
<br/><br/>
We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal information.
<br/><br/>
Game7 DAO has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Game7 DAO will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.
<h3>Your rights with respect to your personal data</h3>

<br/><br/>
You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.
<br/><br/>
Right to be informed — Request to know
<br/><br/>
Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:
<ul>
    <li>Whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>

    <li>The categories of personal information that we collect;</li>

    <li>The purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>

Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
<br/><br/>
We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
<br/><br/>
Verification process
<br/><br/>
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
<br/><br/>
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
<br/><br/>
Other privacy rights

    <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
<br/><br/>
You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
<br/><br/>
You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
<br/><br/>
To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at contact@game7.io, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.

We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.`
